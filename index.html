    So you'd like to know how to use impress.js?
    
    You've made the first, very important step - you're reading the source code.
    And that's how impress.js presentations are built - with HTML and CSS code.
    
    Believe me, you need quite decent HTML and CSS skills to be able to use impress.js effectively.
    More importantly, you need to be a designer. There are no default styles or layouts for impress.js presentations.
    
    You need to design and build it by hand.
    
    So...
    
    Would you still like to know how to use impress.js?

        Impress.js doesn't depend on any external stylesheets. It adds all of the styles it needs for the
        presentation to work.
        
        This style below contains styles only for demo presentation. Browse it to see how impress.js
        classes are used to style presentation steps, or how to apply fallback styles, but I don't want
        you to use them directly in your presentation.
        
        Be creative, build your own. We don't really want all impress.js presentations to look the same,
        do we?
        
        When creating your own presentation get rid of this file. Start from scratch, it's fun!

    Body element is used by impress.js to set some useful class names, that will allow you to detect
    the support and state of the presentation in CSS or other scripts.
    
    First very useful class name is `impress-not-supported`. This class means, that browser doesn't
    support features required by impress.js, so you should apply some fallback styles in your CSS.
    It's not necessary to add it manually on this element. If the script detects that browser is not
    good enough it will add this class, but keeping it in HTML means that users without JavaScript
    will also get fallback styles.
    
    When impress.js script detects that browser supports all required features, this class name will
    be removed.
    
    The class name on body element also depends on currently active presentation step. More details about
    it can be found later, when `hint` element is being described.
    
-->
<body class="impress-not-supported">

<!--
    For example this fallback message is only visible when there is `impress-not-supported` class on body.
-->
<div class="fallback-message">
    <p>Your browser <b>doesn't support the features required</b> by impress.js, so you are presented with a simplified version of this presentation.</p>
    <p>For the best experience please use the latest <b>Chrome</b>, <b>Safari</b> or <b>Firefox</b> browser.</p>
</div>

<!--
    
    Now that's the core element used by impress.js.
    
    That's the wrapper for your presentation steps. In this element all the impress.js magic happens.
    It doesn't have to be a `<div>`. Only `id` is important here as that's how the script find it.
    
    You probably won't need it now, but there are some configuration options that can be set on this element.
    
    To change the duration of the transition between slides use `data-transition-duration="2000"` giving it
    a number of ms. It defaults to 1000 (1s).
    
    You can also control the perspective with `data-perspective="500"` giving it a number of pixels.
    It defaults to 1000. You can set it to 0 if you don't want any 3D effects.
    If you are willing to change this value make sure you understand how CSS perspective works:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/perspective
    
    But as I said, you won't need it for now, so don't worry - there are some simple but interesting things
    right around the corner of this tag ;)
    
    ----------
    Plugins: We set the default time for autoplay plugin to 6 seconds. Autoplay will automatically advance
    to next slide after a timeout expires.
    
-->
<div id="impress" data-autoplay="0">

    <!--
        
        Here is where interesting thing start to happen.
        
        Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
        of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
        the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.
        
        Positioning information is passed through data attributes.
        
        In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element with `data-x="-1000"`
        and `data-y="-1500"` attributes. This means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center)
        will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'.
        
        It will not be rotated or scaled.
        
        --------
        Plugins: For first slide, set the autoplay time to a custom 10 seconds.
        
    -->
   

    <!--
        
        The `id` attribute of the step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it's optional.
        If it is not defined, it will get a default value of `step-N` where N is a number of slide.
        
        So in the example below it'll be `step-2`.
        
        The hash part of the url when this step is active will be `#/step-2`.
        
        You can also use `#step-2` in a link, to point directly to this particular step.
        
        Please note, that while `#/step-2` (with slash) would also work in a link it's not recommended.
        Using classic `id`-based links like `#step-2` makes these links usable also in fallback mode.

        This is an example of step element being scaled.
        
        Again, we use a `data-` attribute, this time it's `data-scale="4"`, so it means that this
        element will be 4 times larger than the others.
        From presentation and transitions point of view it means, that it will have to be scaled
        down (4 times) to make it back to its correct size.

          To know if we should fully embrace or minimize globalization we must look at specific examples of each of the four pillars of globalization; Trade Liberalization, Westernization, Technological Advancement, and Global Integration. The effects of globalization need to be taken into account as well.  How globalization shapes identity, affects the economy,  removes barriers (Trade Liberalization), and the legacies of globalization will be addressed. I will find examples in history of the four factors as well as modern examples. These four factors should infer the extent we should embrace globalization.

    <!--
        
        And now it gets really exciting! We move into third dimension!
        
        Along with `data-x` and `data-y`, you can define the position on third (Z) axis, with
        `data-z`. In the example below we use `data-z="-3000"` meaning that element should be
        positioned far away from us (by 3000px).

        This step here doesn't introduce anything new when it comes to data attributes, but you
        should notice in the demo that some words of this text are being animated.
        It's a very basic CSS transition that is applied to the elements when this step element is
        reached.
        
        At the very beginning of the presentation all step elements are given the class of `future`.
        It means that they haven't been visited yet.
        
        When the presentation moves to given step `future` is changed to `present` class name.
        That's how animation on this step works - text moves when the step has `present` class.
        
        Finally when the step is left the `present` class is removed from the element and `past`
        class is added.
        
        So basically every step element has one of three classes: `future`, `present` and `past`.
        Only one current step has the `present` class.
        
        Note: data-x/y/z attributes, if not defined, by default will inherit the value of the
        previous step. So to get back to 0 on the z-axis, we must set it to 0.
        See src/plugins/rel/README.md for more information.

        Since its founding in 1947 at the Bretton Wood conference, the World Bank’s primary goal has been to reduce extreme poverty. It has attempted to do this by bridging the gap between wealthy and poor countries. The bank tries to give poor countries resources from wealthier countries to bridge the gap between the two. It shapes identity because the World Bank is controlled by the most powerful countries in the world which are mostly in the west. This results in western ideals (Westernization) being pushed onto the developing countries which eventually decrease their identity.

      <p align="left" style="font-size:20px;">
        In the 1993 a sociologist, George Ritzler wrote a book on the globalization of the Mcdonald’s fun chain. In the book he discussed how Mcdonalds was majorly marginalizing the world into one culture. This statement was backed up by four points; efficiency, calculability, predictability/standardization, and control.
      <p align="left" style="font-size:20px;">
        Efficiency is defined as an optimal method for completing a task. In Ritzler’s case the fastest way to get from being hungry to being nourished.
      </p>
      <p align="left" style="font-size:20px;">
        Calculability in Ritzler’s case was that a high quantity but lower quality product will equal a low quantity but a high quality product.
      </p>
      <p align="left" style="font-size:20px;">
        Predictability/Standardization refers to the point that no matter where someone goes they will receive the same service and product a (standard).
      </p>
      <p align="left" style="font-size:20px;">
        Control in Ritzler’s eyes was to eventually replace humans doing a task with non-human technologies.

        Through those four ideas McDonald's has been able to shape people's identities. World wide McDonalds and has affected cultures.  Example: Japan
      <p align="left" style="font-size:20px;">
        In 1971, the first McDonald's in Japan was opened by a local restaurant owner. In Japanese culture, food is to be eaten together sharing the meal. McDonald’s burgers are meant to be eaten individually so they adopted the McRice, therefore allowing food to be shared. Later, chairs and tables were removed from the seating areas and replaced with large counters to eat from. This would later be adopted in other Mcdonald's restaurants, however not all locations have moved to this model.
      </p>
      <p align="left" style="font-size:20px;">
        It is fair to say that nowadays, consumer do not care what model the restaurant is as Japan makes a considerable amount of the profits for McDonalds globally.
      </p>
      <p align="left" style="font-size:20px;">
      Mcdonaldization has created many pros and cons:
      </p>
      <p align="left" style="font-size:20px;">Pros:</p>
      <ul align="left" style="font-size:20px;">
        <li>Has created a standard worldwide as to what to expect for service. </li>
        <li>Japan is one of the most profitable countries in the Mcdonald's chain. </li>

      <p align="left" style="font-size:20px;">Cons:</p>
      <ul align="left" style="font-size:20px;">
        <li>In doing so has decreased diversity in specific collective groups identity worldwide marginalizing the world.</li>
        <li>It is demonstrated that collective groups do not care as Japan has gone away from its collective identity of eating in groups and sharing food together.</li>

      <h1>Benefits & Downsides of Globalization Affecting Identity</h1>
      <p align="left" style="font-size:20px;">
        The World Bank is mainly controlled by the rich and powerful western countries which has left disparity across the globe. Today, the World Bank is still controlled by the rich and powerful countries. Although, through McDonaldization they are able to greatly affect Identity by marginalizing the world to the western ways. I believe there needs to be slight changes so that cultures are not affected as much. Instead of having a standard for all McDonalds worldwide, there could be specific standards within different countries reflecting specific cultural values. This would allow different cultures to continue to exist which can grow in their own direction rather then following the west.

        The British took over India by having power in three aspects that control the market; land, labour, and resources. Since the British controlled Indian affairs many horrific acts resulted. However, Gandhi peacefully used the British laws to fight India’s sovereignty. The freedom of India took a long time to achieve through peaceful means as they did not use violence to free themselves but instead simply stopped working and attempted to crash the market. The British did however use means of violence to get citizens back to work. Through the removal of trade barriers the British took advantage of the Indians and pushed western ideals on them.

       The goal of the IMF is to keep track of the global economy and countries economies inside the IMF. The IMF tells countries how to improve their economies and risks that their economies have. As we learned in watching the dolphin documentary, global governments that are “controlled by no country” can be compromised by unethical practices by member countries through vote buying. Each country in the world government is only supposed to have one vote, however the wealthier countries can buy votes, essentially controlling the global economy.

        <li>Embracing a global economy would result in embracing westernization as the powerful countries are in the west and have the ability to control the global economies.  I believe we need to embrace some aspects of a global economy like the UN if they are willing to change and distribute power more equally.</li>

      <h1>Pros & Cons of Embracing a Global Economy</h1>
    
      <p align="left" style="font-size:25px;">
       As the global economy is embraced it has made wealthy countries wealthier and given them power in history. In India, Gandhi and the people fought peacefully against it and removed the British from India. Today the same problem exists as wealthy countries have control over what is supposed to be governed by all countries fairly. In Canada this is not a grave concern since Canada is one of the wealthier developed countries and somewhat has a voice globally even though it is not as big as the US. If one is living in a developing country with no power than it can be disastrous because that country’s voice will probably not get heard. In a way this is similar to the problems India had as what they wanted they did not get for a long time. If Global Economies are to be embraced to a full extent then there will need to be changes to allow a more equal distribution of power.

        The Silk Road was a trade network between the Ottoman Empire, China, and Europe. The Silk Road was established 130 B.C. and was used until 1453 A.D. It was a huge road that connected many countries together for trade. However, the increased trade between nations also increased diseases. Thus, the Silk Road was shut down and many small villages adjoining the road were abandoned shortly after the exploration of the “New World” began.

        North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), now known as USMCA has tripled trade between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, as well, it has  increased economic output. NAFTA created 5.4 million jobs and supported 17.7 million across the three countries. NAFTA has also caused hundreds of thousands of jobs to be lost in the US, specifically in the manufacturing sector. Mexican farmers were put out of business because there were no tariffs on food.

        In history it benefited a lot of people economically through the countries connected to the silk road and helped with the spread of diseases. However, nowadays with modern medicine the spread of diseases isn’t as big of a problem. The benefits today are they benefit the economy drastically giving millions of people jobs. It does hurt a select few industries and thousands lost their jobs like farming sectors and manufacturing.

        <p align="left" style="font-size:25px;">
        In Canada once the Europeans had established forts they began to make treaties with the First Nations peoples of Canada. These were called the Numbered Treaties. The First Nations would receive limited land, monetary compensation, farming tools, and education. The Europeans/Canadians would receive land rights, promise of peace, law, and order, and restricted use of alcohol on reserves. Later, the Indian Act was passed and focused on three mains points; band councils, reserves and status Indians. The main goal of this act was to assimilate the Native people into the European way of life. Residential schools were a primary way to assimilate First Nations children as we saw in the film. This resulted with children being mistreated and abused. Their relatives did not know understand what was happening on the Residential schools and when the children escaped they were sent back because it was the law and the relatives thought the school was helping.

        In today's world First Nations still have to live with the legacies of the terrible actions of the past. The World’s Health Organization identified the European colonization as severely affecting the health of indigenous people. Indigenous people have a higher rate of death at an early age and have higher rate of diabetes and heart problems.

      <p align="left" style="font-size:30px;">
        With the legacies, we can chose to try and fix problems in which are ancestors have left behind. For the first Nations we can do more than just apologize, we can do the points on the “94 Calls to Action”. We can also help them by giving them more accessible hospitals and medical supplies. Donations or rehab centers can be established closer to their residences to help with drugs and alcoholism so First Nations have accessibility to help like those facilities that exist in city centres.

    <p align="left" style="font-size:30px;">I believe that we need to embrace some aspects of globalization, while others aspects need to change immediately, and some others are not as pressing of matters. Legacies need to be changed immediately and the relationship between First Nations needs to be repaired. The way in which globalization affects identity needs to be minimally changed . McDonald’s could have certain standards within a country or each specific collective group, creating more diversity among McDonald’s worldwide. I believe agreements like NAFTA or USMCA need to be fully embraced as they benefit all three partners with only small downsides. We need to change the global economy so that it becomes equal for more partners not just the rich and powerful countries in the west. I do believe wealthier countries should have a greater vote but all countries  should have their voices heard and be recognized so that they may grow and be able to prosper one day too.

        And the last one shows full power and flexibility of impress.js.
        
        You can not only position element in 3D, but also rotate it around any axis.
        So this one here will get rotated by -40 degrees (40 degrees anticlockwise) around X axis and
        10 degrees (clockwise) around Y axis.
        
        You can of course rotate it around Z axis with `data-rotate-z` - it has exactly the same effect
        as `data-rotate` (these two are basically aliases).
        
    -->
    <div id="its-in-3d" class="step" data-x="6200" data-y="4300" data-z="-100" data-rotate-x="-40" data-rotate-y="10" data-scale="2">
        <p><span class="have">The</span> <span class="you">End</span></p>
    </div>

    <!--
        
        So to summarize of all the possible attributes used to position presentation steps, we have:
        
        * `data-x`, `data-y`, `data-z` - they define the position of **the center** of step element on
            the canvas in pixels; their default value is 0;
        * `data-rotate-x`, `data-rotate-y`, 'data-rotate-z`, `data-rotate` - they define the rotation of
            the element around given axis in degrees; their default value is 0; `data-rotate` and `data-rotate-z`
            are exactly the same;
        * `data-scale` - defines the scale of step element; default value is 1
        
        These values are used by impress.js in CSS transformation functions, so for more information consult
        CSS transfrom docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/transform

    This is a UI plugin. You can read more about plugins in src/plugins/README.md.
    For now, I'll just tell you that this adds some graphical controls to navigate the

    Hint is not related to impress.js in any way.
    
    But it can show you how to use impress.js features in creative way.
    
    When the presentation step is shown (selected) its element gets the class of "active" and the body element
    gets the class based on active step id `impress-on-ID` (where ID is the step's id)... It may not be
    so clear because of all these "ids" in previous sentence, so for example when the first step (the one with
    the id of `bored`) is active, body element gets a class of `impress-on-bored`.
    
    This class is used by this hint below. Check CSS file to see how it's shown with delayed CSS animation when
    the first step of presentation is visible for a couple of seconds.
    
    ...
    
    And when it comes to this piece of JavaScript below ... kids, don't do this at home ;)
    It's just a quick and dirty workaround to get different hint text for touch devices.
    In a real world it should be at least placed in separate JS file ... and the touch content should be
    probably just hidden somewhere in HTML - not hard-coded in the script.
    
    Just sayin' ;)
    
-->
<div class="hint">
    <p>Use a spacebar or arrow keys to navigate. <br/>
       Press 'P' to launch speaker console.</p>
</div>
<script>
if ("ontouchstart" in document.documentElement) {
    document.querySelector(".hint").innerHTML = "<p>Swipe left or right to navigate</p>";
}
</script>

<!--
    
    Last, but not least.
    
    To make all described above really work, you need to include impress.js in the page.
    I strongly encourage to minify it first.
    
    In here I just include full source of the script to make it more readable.
    
    You also need to call a `impress().init()` function to initialize impress.js presentation.
    And you should do it in the end of your document. Not only because it's a good practice, but also
    because it should be done when the whole document is ready.
    Of course you can wrap it in any kind of "DOM ready" event, but I was too lazy to do so ;)
    
-->
<script src="js/impress.js"></script>
<script>impress().init();</script>

<!--
    
    The `impress()` function also gives you access to the API that controls the presentation.
    
    Just store the result of the call:
    
        var api = impress();
    
    and you will get three functions you can call:
    
        `api.init()` - initializes the presentation,
        `api.next()` - moves to next step of the presentation,
        `api.prev()` - moves to previous step of the presentation,
        `api.goto( stepIndex | stepElementId | stepElement, [duration] )` - moves the presentation to the step given by its index number
                id or the DOM element; second parameter can be used to define duration of the transition in ms,
                but it's optional - if not provided default transition duration for the presentation will be used.
    
    You can also simply call `impress()` again to get the API, so `impress().next()` is also allowed.
    Don't worry, it wont initialize the presentation again.
    
    For some example uses of this API check the last part of the source of impress.js where the API
    is used in event handlers.

<!--
    
    Now you know more or less everything you need to build your first impress.js presentation, but before
    you start...
    
    Oh, you've already cloned the code from GitHub?
    
    You have it open in text editor?
    
    Stop right there!
    
    That's not how you create awesome presentations. This is only a code. Implementation of the idea that
    first needs to grow in your mind.
    
    So if you want to build great presentation take a pencil and piece of paper. And turn off the computer.
    
    Sketch, draw and write. Brainstorm your ideas on a paper. Try to build a mind-map of what you'd like
    to present. It will get you closer and closer to the layout you'll build later with impress.js.
    
    Get back to the code only when you have your presentation ready on a paper. It doesn't make sense to do
    it earlier, because you'll only waste your time fighting with positioning of useless points.
    
    If you think I'm crazy, please put your hands on a book called "Presentation Zen". It's all about
    creating awesome and engaging presentations.
    
    Think about it. 'Cause impress.js may not help you, if you have nothing interesting to say.
